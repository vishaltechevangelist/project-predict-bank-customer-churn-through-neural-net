README: Bank Customer Churn Prediction using ANN üè¶
Project Description
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Customer churn, or the loss of customers, is a significant challenge for businesses. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to leave, a bank can proactively take measures to retain them, such as offering special deals or improving services. This model leverages a deep learning approach to identify complex, non-linear patterns in customer data that traditional models might miss.

Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named 'Churn_Modelling.csv'. It contains information about bank customers and includes 10,000 records across 14 features. The dataset is ideal for a supervised machine learning task, where the goal is to classify customers as either "churned" or "not churned."

Key features in the dataset include:

Customer-specific information: CustomerId, Surname

Demographics: CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age

Account-specific data: Tenure (how long they've been a customer), Balance, NumOfProducts (number of bank products used), HasCrCard (whether they have a credit card), IsActiveMember (whether they are an active member)

Predictive features: EstimatedSalary

Target variable: Exited (1 if the customer churned, 0 otherwise)

Activities Performed
1. Data Preprocessing
Loading and inspection: The dataset was loaded using pandas. Initial checks were performed to understand its structure, identify missing values, and analyze the data types.

Feature engineering: Categorical features like 'Geography' and 'Gender' were converted into numerical formats using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for the ANN model. The Exited column was designated as the target variable.

Feature scaling: Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler. This is a crucial step for ANNs as it helps the model converge faster and perform better by ensuring all features are on a similar scale.

2. Model Development
ANN architecture: A sequential model was built using Keras, a high-level API for TensorFlow. The network architecture consists of:

An input layer that matches the number of features.

Two hidden layers with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.

An output layer with a sigmoid activation function, which is ideal for binary classification problems as it outputs a probability between 0 and 1.

Model compilation: The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, which is an efficient optimization algorithm. The binary cross-entropy loss function was used, as it's the standard for binary classification, and the performance was monitored using accuracy as the metric.

3. Training and Evaluation
Splitting data: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Model training: The ANN was trained on the training data for a specified number of epochs with a defined batch size.

Model evaluation: The trained model's performance was evaluated on the test set using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score, providing a comprehensive view of its predictive power.
